Animation is an underutilized pedagogical tool when teaching physics. Many (most?) physical concepts are inherently multi-dimensional, making it impossible to present all the information about them in a single static image. Examples of this include the plotting of 3D functions like quantum wavefunctions or electronic bandstructures, which are almost exclusively only presented in the literature as lower-dimensional slices of the full quantities. While this is usually fine for the experienced reader, it is a poor means of providing students with an intuition for these concepts. 

To address this perceived gap in the standard pedagogy, this suite of scripts generates a variety of dashboards that allow students to interactively explore various physics concepts, with the goal of providing them with a deeper understanding of topics that do not lend themselves well to static textbook figures. From playing with parameters like frequency and amplitude to see how they affect the profile of a sinusoidal function, to sweeping through **every** 2D slice of a 3D wavefunction, a hands-on tool that allows students to explore the full parameter space of a particular concept in detail would be an excellent suplement to any class.
