Animation is a severely underutilized pedagogical tool when teaching physics. Many (most?) physical are inherently multi-dimensional, making it impossible to present all the information about them in a single static image. Examples of this include the plotting of 3D functions like quantum wavefunctions or electronic bandstructures, which are almost exclusively only presented in the literature as lower-dimensional slices of the full quantities. While this is usually fine for the experienced reader, it is a poor means of providing students with an intuition for these concepts. ('Spaghetti diagrams' in particular are notoriously difficult for new students to interpret.) 

To address this perceived gap in the standard pedagogy, this suite of scripts generate a variety of dashboards that allow students interactively explore various physics concepts, with the goal of providing them with a deeper understanding of concepts that do not lend themselves well to static textbook figures. From playing with parameters like frequency and amplitude to see how they affect the profile of a sinusoidal function, to controlling the time-evolution of a travelling wave superposition problem, a hands-on tool that allows students to explore the parameter space of a particular concept themselves would be an excellent suplement to any class.
